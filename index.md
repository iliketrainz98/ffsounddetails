| No.| Item               |
|----|--------------------|
| 1  | Tom                |
| 2  | Max                |

*Note: if you are using a monitor wedge instead of in-ear monitors for Vocal/Horns, then you need to plug into `Aux 6` on the back of the mixer.*

## Mixer Setup

### Initial Setup
1. Plug in/switch on the **router and mixer**
2. **Connect the speakers**, switch on, and make sure these are at the **correct volume**
3. Connect to the mixer using the app and load the `FF Master - MM YY` snapshot (folder icon to the top right) in the Mixing Station App.
4. Turn up the L/R fader to **`-15dB`**. *This is found under* `FX Snd/Main` *on the right handside. If you need more volume, turn the speakers up.*
5. Unmute the Aux channel (ensure the `Mute Enable` button is highlighted), and check you get volume out of both speakers. This is found under `Aux/FX Ret` on the right hand-side. (You can breathe now)
6. (*Optional - If Time*) Ring out the system (see below)

*Note: In Ear Monitors are turned on by default, but the 'Wedge' send master fader is turned down by default (to avoid feedback). You can adjust the master volume under `Mix` in the mixing station app, or the master fader in MX-Q*

### Soundcheck
1. For **each** channel/instrument:
    1. Ensure the channel is **muted**
    2. Get player to **play/sing** at their **loudest volume**. *NB for drums, ask for single hits on each drum e.g. Kick, Snare etc., and then the whole kit*
    3. Set the gain so that the meter to the side of the fader is **on average `-18dB`**. You can do this by tapping once on the channel name (e.g. `Kick`) and you should find gain on the top left hand side.
    4. **Unmute** the channel
    5. Adjust the volume in the room until the mix feels right.
2. Start by getting individual instruments sounding good, and then adjust the mix until you are happy
3. Save the current settings as a **snapshot**. This is crucial in case there is an issue and you need to revert settings before the start of the gig!

*Note: By pressing 'Gain' on the right hand side changes the faders to adjust the gain of each channel. This saves you time having to go in an adjust the gain of each instrument by tapping on the channel name.*


### "Ringing Out" a PA System (Speakers) and Monitor Wedges
Do this to the monitor wedge and main speakers to eliminate feedback.
I'll writeup a guide shortly, but the concept is explained in [This Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiISq4GUYi4)


## During the Gig
### Between the sets
1. Turn up the `Aux` fader to play break music. This is found under `Aux/FX Ret` on the right hand-side.
2. Turn down the `Band` DCA all the way. This stops the sound of the band instruments coming out the speakers. **Ensure your turn this back up again before starting**. This is found under `DCA` on the right hand-side.

## Packdown
1. Turn **down the L/R fader**. This is found under `FX Snd/Main` on the right hand-side.
2. Turn the speakers **off**
3. *(Optional)* **Save** your current snapshot
4. **Turn off** the mixer


## Top Tips:
* Keep the mixer app up throughout the gig
* Be careful not to adjust someone else's in ear mix by accident! This is done if you select one of the busses e.g. `Tom` by accident. Tap on the bus again e.g. `Tom` to **return to the L/R main mix**. *Note: the mix you are editing is always shown on the top left of the app*.

## Troubleshooting
No sound coming out? *(Aghh panic....)*

**If signal is being detected** (i.e. the meter next to the fader is showing sound coming through), there is an **issue with mixer OR the output**, follow these steps:
1. Is the `Master (L/R)` fader **turned down/muted**?
2. Is the DCA (e.g. the `Band` Fader) **turned down/muted**?
3. Is the **channel muted**?
4. Are the **speakers turned on/plugged in**?

If no signal is being detected, there is an issue with the source:
1. Is the source **plugged in** (mic, instrument etc.) to the **correct channel**?
2. Is the source **turned on**?
3. Is the gain set **really low**?
4. Is the **cable faulty**?
