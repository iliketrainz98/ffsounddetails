# Troubleshooting
No sound coming out?

If signal is being detected (i.e. the meter next to the fader is showing sound coming through), there is an issue with the output, follow these steps:
1. Is the Master (L/R) fader turned down/muted?
2. Is the DCA (e.g Band Fader) turned down?
3. Is the channel muted?
4. Are the speakers turned on/plugged in

If no signal is being detected, there is an issue with the source:
1. Is the source plugged in (mic, instrument etc.) to the correct channel?
2. Is the source turned on?
3. Is the cable faulty - try another cable.
